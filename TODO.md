## Plugins Ideas

### Circled annotations

The goal is to annotate code with circled numbers anywhere, then use refer these numbers directly in the text.

The proposed syntax is simply `((1))` where the number can go from `1..50` (Matching unicode circled numbers). These numbers can be refered in the text with the same syntax `((1))`.

Numbers are linked to the closest code block located in the same section. If the code block is located in another section, the number is not linked and a warning is displayed.

An animation can be triggered when hovering the number, showing the corresponding tag in code block.
