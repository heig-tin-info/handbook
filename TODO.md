## Plugins Ideas

### Circled annotations

The goal is to annotate code with circled numbers anywhere, then use refer these numbers directly in the text.

The proposed syntax is simply `((1))` where the number can go from `1..50` (Matching unicode circled numbers). These numbers can be refered in the text with the same syntax `((1))`.

Numbers are linked to the closest code block located in the same section. If the code block is located in another section, the number is not linked and a warning is displayed.

An animation can be triggered when hovering the number, showing the corresponding tag in code block.

### Tags/Index

My hook `tags` allows for creating tags related to a section. On LaTeX side it adds an index entry. The syntax is the following:

```markdown
The [[tag]] will be added in the index. But when we have several [[tags|tag]], we want to only add the singular form.
Alternatively, we could add a tag or an index entry without text [[|tag]]. Sometime we want different values for :

- The text in the document
- The tag in MkDocs
- The entry in the index table

We can therefore use: [[text|tag|entry]], for exemple for this wonderful movie, [[The Matrix|Matrix|Matrix, The]].
```

### Code execution

Sometime I say `C language has been in the wild for more than 25 years`. It wuld be better to say `{{years_since(1972)}}`. Year since would be a script located in a script folder and executed by MkDocs. It could be a function or a filename.
